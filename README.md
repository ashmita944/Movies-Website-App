Movie & Anime Info Web App
Description

This project is a movie and anime information web application where users can search for movies and anime series and view their details.
The anime data is fetched using the Jikan API, which provides information from MyAnimeList.

This project was created to improve my understanding of API integration, JavaScript logic, and real-world frontend–backend interaction.
